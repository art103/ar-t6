# ar-t6

forked from art103/ar-t6

get [the latest version of binary](https://github.com/prikrylm/ar-t6/blob/master/binary/ar-t6.bin) from bin folder.

main improvements 
- modes - MODE 1-4
- heli settings (cyc 90°, 120°, 120X°, 140°)
- timer (abs, switch triggered, throttle 10% triggered, throttle proportional (%))
- switch warning screen
- new settings menu images
- font correction
- working backlight management
- almost nice roller accelerating for faster move to bigger "numbers" (ie. moving curve point from -100 to 100)

### Known issues
- if some heli swash plate type is selected, AIL and ELE behaves as 90° CYC1 and CYC2


### Current ToDo List
- shrink binary to 64kB
- templates
- Custom switches 
- negagive Safety switches ie !SD...
